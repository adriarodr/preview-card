## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

At first, I had no idea how to implement the product image and have it switch to image-product-desktop.jpg. I thought about using the background-image property with a div. However, I wasn't satisfied with that. After a google search, I came across the picture tag. The picture tag is very helpful whenever multiple images are displayed at specific widths. Since I was building the mobile version of the site first, I made image-product-mobile.jpg the default by placing it in an img tag and used the source tag to link to my image-product-desktop.jpg and set the media to min-width: 40rem, meaning the image would replace the default image when the screen size is above 640px.

(See below for my snippet)

```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
    media="(min-width: 40rem)"
  />

  <img
    class="card__img"
    src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum Perfume Bottle"
  />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

I will continue to grow comfortable with media queries, optimization, responsive designs, and expanding on accessibility in future projects.

Even though this challenge did not require JavaScript, I would like to learn JavaScript to complete advanced challenges and bring my personal projects to the next level.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Kevin Powellâ€™s videos are extremely helpful for any beginner like me. He has many videos dedicated to tutorials such as grids, flexboxes, and tricks/hacks. He taught me HTML5 landmarks, CUBE CSS methodology, and other tips and tricks. I recommend beginners watch his videos.

- [A Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - I used this simple CSS reset at the beginning of my CSS by Andy Bell and recommended by Kevin Powell in many of his videos. Resets are very helpful in reducing any inconsistencies between browsers. However, it's not necessary.
